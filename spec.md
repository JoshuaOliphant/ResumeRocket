## Task-Specific Implementation Prompts

### Prompt 0.1: Enhanced ATS Analyzer Core Implementation
```
Implement a more sophisticated ATS analyzer that provides accurate and calibrated scoring. Your implementation should:

1. Develop a weighted keyword matching system that considers:
   - Keyword position in job description (title/headers vs body)
   - Keyword frequency and prominence
   - Semantic importance (skills vs generic terms)

2. Add n-gram analysis to detect multi-word phrases (e.g., "machine learning" instead of just "machine" and "learning")

3. Implement section-based analysis:
   - Identify resume sections (experience, education, skills, etc.)
   - Provide section-specific scores and suggestions
   - Weight matches by section relevance to job requirements

4. Create a skills taxonomy system:
   - Recognize skill hierarchies (e.g., "Python" implies "programming")
   - Identify when a resume lists superset skills that cover job requirements
   - Map related technologies and skills

5. Calibrate scoring against industry benchmarks:
   - Research typical ATS scoring distributions
   - Implement score normalization for realistic 0-100 range
   - Add confidence levels for score accuracy

6. Improve the algorithm for calculating overall score:
   - Consider keyword density and placement
   - Factor in completeness of skill coverage
   - Account for resume length and content-to-noise ratio

The enhanced analyzer should be more precise in identifying true matches while reducing false negatives, leading to more realistic and helpful scores.
```

### Prompt 0.2: Semantic Matching Using Embeddings or Claude
```
Implement semantic matching capabilities to find conceptually related skills rather than just exact keyword matches. Your implementation should:

1. Develop a system that can recognize semantic similarity between:
   - Different terms for the same skill (e.g., "data analysis" vs "analyzing data")
   - Related technologies (e.g., "React" and "JavaScript")
   - Equivalent qualifications or credentials

2. Use one of these methods to implement semantic matching:
   - Option A: Integrate with Claude API to evaluate semantic similarity between resume skills and job requirements
   - Option B: Use pre-trained embeddings and vector similarity for matching related concepts

3. Create a confidence scoring system for semantic matches:
   - High confidence for direct matches
   - Medium confidence for closely related skills
   - Low confidence for tangentially related concepts

4. Implement a fallback chain:
   - Try exact match first
   - Fall back to semantic matching when exact matches aren't found
   - Provide clear identification of match type in the analysis

5. Incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve matching over time:
   - Track which suggestions users accept vs. reject
   - Use this data to refine semantic matching confidence thresholds

This feature will dramatically improve the system's ability to recognize when a candidate has relevant skills that aren't expressed using the exact terminology in the job description.
```

### Prompt 0.3: Two-Stage Resume Customization with Claude
```
Implement a two-stage resume customization process using Claude for more effective results. Your implementation should:

1. Update the resume_customizer.py to implement a two-stage approach:
   - Stage 1: Analysis - Have Claude analyze the resume against the job, identifying specific opportunities for improvement
   - Stage 2: Optimization - Have Claude implement those specific improvements in a separate prompt

2. Create an enhanced system prompt for Claude:
   - Add expert context about resume optimization
   - Include detailed instructions on maintaining authenticity
   - Set parameters for acceptable modification types

3. Separate functional concerns in the prompt structure:
   - Instructions (what to do) vs. context (resume/job content)
   - Analysis logic vs. generation logic
   - Core requirements vs. edge case handling

4. Implement specific parameters for customization:
   - Customization aggressiveness level (conservative to extensive)
   - Focus areas (skills emphasis, experience framing, etc.)
   - Format preservation strictness

5. Add a "reasoning" section to the output:
   - Explain why specific changes were made
   - Document the before/after for key modifications
   - Provide the reasoning behind keyword additions

This approach will lead to more thoughtful, strategic resume customizations that better align with job requirements while maintaining authenticity.
```

### Prompt 0.4: ATS Simulation and Industry-Specific Guidance
```
