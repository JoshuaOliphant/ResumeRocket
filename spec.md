## Task-Specific Implementation Prompts

### ✅ Prompt 1: PDF Caching and Performance Optimization (COMPLETED)
```
Implemented a database-backed caching mechanism that:
- Uses SHA-256 hashing of PDF content as a cache key
- Stores extracted content in the database with metadata
- Tracks usage metrics (hit count, last accessed time)
- Includes automatic cache cleanup to prevent unlimited growth
- Features detailed logging of cache hits and misses
- Significantly reduces processing time for previously seen PDFs

Implementation details can be found in the pdf_extraction.md documentation.
```

### ✅ Prompt 2: Enhanced PDF Extraction with PyMuPDF (COMPLETED)
```
Implemented an improved PDF extraction system using PyMuPDF (fitz) that:

1. Replaces the previous PyPDF2-based extraction with a more robust solution
2. Provides superior text extraction with better layout preservation
3. Handles complex document structures like multiple columns and tables
4. Maintains better formatting and structure from the original PDF
5. Delivers 3-5x performance improvement compared to the previous approach
6. Includes detailed logging with performance metrics
7. Fully integrates with the existing caching system

The advanced extraction capabilities of PyMuPDF provide more reliable results for a wide range of PDF layouts commonly used in resumes, eliminating the need for fallback methods.
```

### Prompt 3: Section Collapsing/Expanding Functionality
```
Implement section collapsing and expanding functionality for the resume comparison view. Your implementation should:

1. Identify resume sections based on headings or other structural elements
2. Add UI controls (arrows or icons) to collapse/expand each identified section
3. Create JavaScript functions to handle the collapse/expand interactions
4. Ensure both the original and customized views stay synchronized when collapsing/expanding
5. Add smooth animations for the collapse/expand actions
6. Preserve the collapsed/expanded state when switching between different view modes
7. Ensure the feature works on both desktop and mobile views

This will help users focus on specific sections of interest in longer resumes.
```

### Prompt 4: Search Function for Resume Content
```
Implement a search function that allows users to find specific content in either the original or customized resume. Your implementation should:

1. Add a search input field with appropriate styling to match the existing UI
2. Create JavaScript functions to perform real-time search as the user types
3. Highlight all matching instances of the search term in both resume versions
4. Add navigation controls to jump between multiple search results
5. Show the number of matches found
6. Include options to search in only the original, only the customized, or both versions
7. Ensure the search works with the existing diff highlighting without visual conflicts

This feature will help users quickly locate specific information in either resume version.
```

### Prompt 5: Copy-to-Clipboard Functionality
```
Implement a copy-to-clipboard feature for the resume comparison. Your implementation should:

1. Add buttons to copy the entire customized resume to clipboard
2. Add an option to copy selected sections only (working with the section identification)
3. Create JavaScript functions to handle the clipboard operations
4. Add visual feedback when content is successfully copied
5. Include fallback mechanisms for browsers with restricted clipboard access
6. Ensure the copied content maintains proper formatting
7. Add options to copy as plain text, markdown, or HTML

This will make it easier for users to use their customized resume content in other applications.
```

### Prompt 6: Hover Effects for Corresponding Changes
```
Implement hover effects to highlight corresponding changes between the original and customized resume versions. Your implementation should:

1. Modify the existing diff highlighting to add unique identifiers to corresponding changes
2. Create JavaScript functions to detect mouse hover events on diff-highlighted elements
3. Add visual effects that highlight the corresponding change in the other column
4. Ensure the highlighting is obvious but not distracting (consider using a subtle background color or border)
5. Make sure the feature works with all view modes
6. Add smooth transitions for the highlighting effects
7. Ensure the feature is performant, even with many changes

This will help users easily see how specific content changed between versions.
```

### Prompt 7: Line Numbers and Reference Indicators
```
Add line numbers and reference indicators to the resume comparison view. Your implementation should:

1. Add line numbers to both the original and customized resume columns
2. Ensure line numbers stay synchronized when scrolling
3. Make line numbers visually distinct but unobtrusive
4. Add the ability to link to specific lines (for sharing purposes)
5. Add visual indicators in the scrollbar showing where changes are located
6. Color-code the scrollbar indicators based on the type of change (addition, deletion, modification)
7. Ensure the feature works across different browsers and screen sizes

This will improve navigation and help users quickly locate changes within longer resumes.
```

### Prompt 8: Inline Comments and Tooltips
```
Implement inline comments and tooltips to explain significant changes in the customized resume. Your implementation should:

1. Add tooltips that appear when hovering over changed sections
2. Include explanatory comments about why the change improves the resume
3. Create a system that categorizes changes (e.g., clarity improvement, keyword addition, formatting)
4. Add visual indicators for sections with explanatory tooltips
5. Ensure tooltips don't obstruct the resume content
6. Make tooltips accessible via keyboard navigation
7. Include an option to show/hide all explanatory comments

This feature will help users understand why specific changes were made and learn how to improve their resume writing.
```

### Prompt 9: First-Time User Onboarding Overlay
```
Create a simple onboarding overlay that explains the resume comparison feature to first-time users. Your implementation should:

1. Design a clean, informative overlay highlighting key features of the comparison view
2. Include annotated screenshots or illustrations explaining the different controls
3. Add step-by-step walkthrough of how to use the comparison tools
4. Create a mechanism to show this only to first-time users (using local storage or cookies)
5. Add the ability to dismiss the overlay and an option to recall it later
6. Make the overlay responsive for all device sizes
7. Ensure the onboarding content is accessible

This will help new users quickly understand and make the most of the comparison feature.
```

### Prompt 10: Screen Reader Compatibility Testing
```
Test and improve the resume comparison feature for screen reader compatibility. Your implementation should:

1. Test the feature with common screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
2. Identify and fix any accessibility issues found during testing
3. Add appropriate ARIA attributes to interactive elements that aren't already accessible
4. Ensure all dynamic content changes are properly announced by screen readers
5. Make sure keyboard navigation works correctly with screen readers
6. Update the accessibility documentation with screen reader testing results
7. Prioritize fixes for any critical accessibility issues discovered

The goal is to ensure the comparison feature is fully accessible to users who rely on screen readers.
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Priority Order**: Tasks are listed in recommended implementation order, but PDF improvements should be highest priority
2. **Independent Development**: Each task can be implemented independently of others if needed
3. **Testing**: Test each component thoroughly before considering it complete
4. **User Focus**: Keep the end-user experience as the primary consideration
5. **Code Quality**: Maintain clean, well-documented code that follows project conventions
6. **Mobile Compatibility**: Ensure all new features work well on all device sizes

## Technical Implementation Notes

1. **PDF Caching**: Consider using Redis or database for distributed environments, or file-system caching for simpler setups
2. **Fallback Extraction**: PyPDF2 or pdfplumber are good fallback options for unstructured.io
3. **Section Management**: Use heading detection, then add collapsible behavior with CSS/JavaScript
4. **Search Implementation**: Consider using a library like mark.js for highlighting search results
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Test features in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

This plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the remaining implementation tasks for the resume comparison feature, with a focus on usability, performance, and accessibility.
