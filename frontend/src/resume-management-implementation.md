# Resume Management Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the resume management features in the Next.js frontend for ResumeRocket, covering resume upload, customization, and result comparison.

## Components Overview

### 1. Resume Upload Page
- **Path**: `/app/resume-upload/page.tsx`
- **Features**: 
  - File upload for PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
  - Direct text input option
  - Real-time validation and error handling
  - Loading states during upload

### 2. Resume Customization Form
- **Path**: `/app/resume-customization/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Resume selection from user's uploaded resumes
  - Job description selection from user's saved jobs
  - Customization level selection (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
  - Optional industry specification for better context
  - Loading states during customization process

### 3. Resume Comparison Results
- **Path**: `/app/resume-comparison/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Side-by-side comparison of original and optimized resumes
  - Detailed changes view with section-by-section breakdown
  - Keyword match analysis with highlighting
  - ATS score comparison with improvement metrics
  - Resume export options (PDF, DOCX, TXT)

## API Integration

### React Query Hooks
- **Path**: `/hooks/use-resume-api.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Centralized data fetching with caching
  - Type-safe query and mutation hooks
  - Automatic cache invalidation on data changes
  - Standardized loading and error states

### Authentication Integration
All API requests automatically include JWT authentication tokens using axios interceptors.

## Data Flow

1. **Resume Upload**:
   - User uploads a file or enters text
   - Frontend converts input to appropriate format
   - API processes the resume and returns content and initial analysis
   - User is redirected to management page or customization page

2. **Resume Customization**:
   - User selects a resume and job description
   - User configures customization options
   - API performs AI-powered customization
   - Results are cached using React Query
   - User is redirected to comparison page

3. **Resume Comparison**:
   - Component fetches comparison data using the resume ID
   - Data is presented in multiple views (side-by-side, details, etc.)
   - User can export the optimized resume in various formats

## Technical Considerations

### Error Handling
- All components implement consistent error handling
- API errors are displayed with appropriate context
- Form validation prevents invalid submissions

### Loading States
- Skeleton loaders for initial data loading
- Button loading states during form submissions
- Progress indicators for long-running operations

### Responsive Design
- All components are fully responsive
- Mobile-friendly input controls
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

## Next Steps

1. **Resume Management Page**: Implement a comprehensive management page for all user's resumes
2. **PDF Generation**: Complete the export functionality for different file formats
3. **Advanced Diff View**: Enhance the comparison with word-level diff highlighting
4. **Batch Processing**: Allow users to customize multiple resumes against the same job
