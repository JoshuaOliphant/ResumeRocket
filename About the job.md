About the job
Who we are:
Stay AI is powered by savvy DTC industry vets, who have each been building subscription programs for over ten years. We’ve worked with over 300+ subscription-focused CPG brands that have generated hundreds of millions of dollars in subscription revenue alone. Our product is shaped by eCommerce experts who specialize in acquisition and retention—and it shows.

We have amazing investors like Telescope Partners, with participation from Boulder Food Group, Riverpark Ventures, and Vanterra Capital. Previous investments were led by Watchfire Ventures, alongside industry leaders such as Nik Sharma (Sharma Brands) and Adam Turner (Postscript). We are not afraid of challenging work and are excited to build the next big thing. Sound good to you? Then, please read more about our role!

Our culture:
We are dedicated to our work, but equally committed to celebrating our achievements. Collaboration is at the heart of everything we do, as we firmly believe in the power of teamwork. While we are remote-first as a company, we try to create opportunities to meet each other. That's why we organize annual offsite retreats in beautiful Park City, Utah and Mexico!

Who you are:
We are looking for a DevOps Engineer to help design, build and scale our infrastructure, which currently serves millions of Shopify customers. Our Engineering team is highly collaborative and the ideal candidate is motivated to build tools and systems that enable teams to move fast to deploy new services rather than relying on DevOps to do the work for them. You’ll collaborate closely with engineering teams to ensure smooth deployments, reliability, and performance. If you thrive in fast-paced environments and love solving infrastructure challenges, we’d love to hear from you.

In a typical day, you might:
Manage containerized environments using Kubernetes
Automate deployment, monitoring, and management processes using CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
Provide options, guidance and approvals to IaC (Infrastructure as Code) changes
Enhance system performance and security
Assist with improving monitoring and alerting pathways in Grafana and PagerDuty to enhance incident response

What You’ll Bring:
6+ years of experience as a DevOps Engineer
Experience with Kubernetes and container orchestration in support of a microservices architecture
Knowledge of Infrastructure as Code best practices in tools like Terraform/OpenTofu and Spacelift
Experience administering AWS products (EKS, RDS, Route 53, etc.)
Understanding of VPCs, VPNs, load balancers, and security best practices in AWS
Proficiency in scripting with Python, Bash, or Go to automate tasks and processes
Experience owning CI/CD tools like Jenkins
Experience supporting reliable, highly scalable cloud based services on platforms like Nest.js
Ability to thrive in a dynamic startup environment, demonstrating adaptability, curiosity, and a willingness to take initiative
A deep passion for crafting delightful experiences and learning new skills
Excellent problem solving skills and the ability to effectively communicate complex concepts across cross-functional teams
Enthusiasm for providing top-notch internal support with patience and professionalism

Nice to haves:
Experience supporting ML engineering or data pipelines
Experience with AWS Lambda and event-driven workflows
Understanding of cloud cost management and optimization strategies
Experience within the eCommerce and/or subscription management space

Why Join Us?: 
For the opportunity to make a huge impact at a high-growth startup
To work alongside Stayers who are fun and collaborative
To contribute to the growth of our product as we scale quickly
