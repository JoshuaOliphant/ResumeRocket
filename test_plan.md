# ResumeRocket Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan outlines the approach for testing the ResumeRocket application, focusing on the modernized frontend components using HTMX, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to ensure that both existing functionality and new features work correctly while maintaining a high level of code quality and user experience.

## Testing Approach

The application testing will be structured in layers:

- **Unit Testing**: Individual component and function testing
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components
- **End-to-End Testing**: Full application flow testing
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Ensuring UI appearance is maintained
- **Performance Testing**: Measuring and optimizing response times
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensuring the application is accessible to all users

## Technology Stack

- **pytest**: For Python backend unit and integration tests
- **Playwright/Selenium**: For browser-based testing and end-to-end scenarios
- **Jest**: For JavaScript unit testing where needed
- **Percy/BackstopJS**: For visual regression testing
- **Lighthouse/WebPageTest**: For performance metrics
- **axe/pa11y**: For accessibility compliance testing

## Test Implementation Plan

    - Test browser back/forward navigation

12. **Edge Case Testing**
    - Test with very large resumes
    - Test with unusual formatting
    - Test with connection interruptions
    - Test with browser extensions and privacy settings

## Implementation Prompts

### Prompt 1: Unit Testing for Search Functionality

```
Implement comprehensive unit tests for the resume search functionality. Your implementation should:

1. Create test fixtures with sample resumes containing known searchable content
2. Test search parsing and result highlighting accuracy
3. Test search with various patterns (case sensitivity, special characters, multi-word phrases)
4. Verify match counting and position tracking
5. Test performance with larger documents

Use pytest for backend testing and include both positive and negative test cases.
```

### Prompt 2: End-to-End Testing for Search UI

```
Create end-to-end tests for the search user interface using Playwright. Your implementation should:

1. Set up a test environment with pre-populated resume content
2. Test the search input, including debouncing behavior
3. Verify that results are highlighted correctly in the UI
4. Test keyboard navigation between search results
5. Verify that the current match indicator works correctly
6. Test search with different scopes (original, customized, both)

Include visual verification of the highlighted content and navigation controls.
```

### Prompt 3: Testing Server-Sent Events

```
Implement tests for the SSE implementation using pytest. Your implementation should:

1. Create mock SSE endpoints that emit events on a schedule
2. Test client connection and event receiving
3. Verify proper handling of different event types
4. Test reconnection behavior after connection loss
5. Measure performance and resource usage during extended connections

Include tests for both streaming updates and search result updates.
```

### Prompt 4: Visual Regression Testing

```
Set up visual regression testing for the ResumeRocket UI components. Your implementation should:

1. Configure Percy or BackstopJS to capture baseline screenshots
2. Create test scenarios for key UI components and pages
3. Test components in different states (loading, error, success)
4. Include tests for both light and dark themes
5. Create a CI workflow to run visual tests on pull requests

Focus particularly on the search, streaming, and comparison components.
```

## Test Automation Infrastructure

```python
# Example test setup for search functionality
def test_search_highlighting():
    # Test data
    html_content = "<p>This is a sample resume with <strong>important keywords</strong> to be found.</p>"
    search_term = "important keywords"
    
    # Call the search function
    results = find_matches(html_content, search_term)
    highlighted = highlight_matches(html_content, results)
    
    # Assert the results are as expected
    assert len(results) == 1
    assert "important keywords" in results[0]["context"]
    assert '<strong><span class="bg-yellow-200 dark:bg-yellow-800">important keywords</span></strong>' in highlighted

# Example test for search navigation
def test_search_navigation():
    # Test with multiple matches
    html_content = "<p>Keyword here</p><p>Another keyword here</p><p>Final keyword mention</p>"
    search_term = "keyword"
    
    # Call the search function
    results = find_matches(html_content, search_term)
    
    # Assert navigation works as expected
    assert len(results) == 3
    assert results[0]["position"] == 1
    assert results[1]["position"] == 2
    assert results[2]["position"] == 3
    assert "Keyword here" in results[0]["context"]
    assert "Another keyword here" in results[1]["context"]
    assert "Final keyword mention" in results[2]["context"]
```

## Continuous Integration Setup

The test automation will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Unit Tests**: Run on every push to any branch
2. **Integration Tests**: Run on PRs to main branch
3. **E2E Tests**: Run on PRs to main branch (subset) and nightly (full suite)
4. **Visual Tests**: Run on PRs to main branch
5. **Performance Tests**: Run weekly and before major releases

## Performance Benchmarks

For key features, we'll establish performance benchmarks:

1. **Search Response Time**: < 200ms for documents up to 50KB
2. **Streaming Updates**: < 100ms latency for updates
3. **Page Load Time**: < 1.5s for initial load, < 500ms for subsequent interactions
4. **Memory Usage**: Monitor for unexpected increases

## Accessibility Testing

All new components should be tested for accessibility:

1. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Test with NVDA/VoiceOver
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: All functions usable without mouse
3. **Color Contrast**: Meet WCAG AA standards
4. **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling, especially for search results

## Manual Test Cases

In addition to automated tests, manual test cases should be performed for:

1. Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Mobile responsiveness
3. Error recovery scenarios
4. Network throttling conditions

## Regression Test Suite

Key regression tests to run before each release:

1. Resume upload and parsing
2. Job description analysis
3. Resume customization streaming
4. Comparison view functionality
5. Search functionality
6. Export to all supported formats
