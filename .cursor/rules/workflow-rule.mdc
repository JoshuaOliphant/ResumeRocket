# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of the code that are relevant to the task.
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task.
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality.
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has show to work well, unless explicitly instructed. If there is a good reason for change, please suggest it first.
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes.
