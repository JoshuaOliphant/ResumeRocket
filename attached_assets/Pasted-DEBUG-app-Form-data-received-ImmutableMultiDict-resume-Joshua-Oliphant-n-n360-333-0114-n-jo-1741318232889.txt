However, some roles may require more time in our offices.  \n  \n**Visa sponsorship:** We do sponsor visas! However, we aren\'t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.  \n  \n**We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.** Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you\'re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we\'re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.  \n  \n****How we\'re different  \n  \n****We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We\'re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time.

Our team\'s engineers are extremely high leverage because we simultaneously drive two of our company\'s largest and fastest growing revenue streams, and we optimize the consumption of one of our most precious resources: compute. Our team ensures our LLMs meet rigorous safety, performance, and security standards and enhance our core infrastructure for packaging, testing, and deploying inference technology. Your work will increase the scale at which our services can operate and accelerate our ability to reliably launch new frontier models and innovative features to customers across all platforms.  \n      \n    \n\n**Responsibilities  \n  \n**\n\n*   Lead build out of industry-leading AI clusters (thousands to hundreds of thousands of machines), partnering closely with cloud service providers on cluster build out and required features\n*   Consult with different stakeholders to deeply understand infrastructure, data and compute needs, identifying potential solutions to support frontier research and product development\n*   Set technical strategy and oversee development of high scale, reliable infrastructure systems.\n*   Mentor top technical talent\n*   Design processes (e.g. postmortem review, incident response, on-call rotations) that help the team operate effectively and never fail the same way twice  \n      \n    \n\n**You may be a good fit if you:  \n  \n**\n\n*   Have 8+ years of relevant industry experience, 3+ years leading large scale, complex projects or teams as an engineer or tech lead\n*   Are obsessed with distributed systems at scale, infrastructure reliability, scalability, security, and continuous improvement\n*   Strong proficiency in at least one programming language (e.g., Python, Rust, Go, Java)\n*   Strong problem-solving skills and ability to work independently\n*   Have a passion for supporting internal partners like research to understand their needs\n*   Have excellent communication skills to build consensus with stakeholders, both internally and externally\n*   Possess deep knowledge of modern cloud infrastructure including Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, AWS, and GCP  \n      \n    \n\n****Strong candidates may also:  \n  \n****\n\n*   Have security and privacy best practice expertise\n*   Experience with machine learning infrastructure like GPUs, TPUs, or Trainium, as well as supporting networking infrastructure like NCCL\n*   Low level systems experience, for example linux kernel tuning and eBPF\n*   Technical expertise: Quickly understanding systems design tradeoffs, keeping track of rapidly evolving software systems  \n      \n    \n\n**Deadline to apply:** None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.  \n  \n**Annual Salary  \n  \n**The expected salary range for this position is:  \n  \n$300,000 — $320,000 USD  \n  \n****Logistics  \n  \n******Education requirements:** We require at least a Bachelor\'s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.  \n  \n**Location-based hybrid policy:** Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.  \n  \n**Visa sponsorship:** We do sponsor visas! However, we aren\'t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.  \n  \n**We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.** Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you\'re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we\'re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.  \n  \n****How we\'re different  \n  \n****We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We\'re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time.
